# PatNet

This is the repository for our project for the course "Foundations of digital humanities" (DH405) at EPFL.

## Concept
The goal is to be able to find morphological links between paintings based on the shape of extracted humans.

You can give as input a list of pictures, that will be passed to SAM3's prompt based segmentor to retrieve the candidate masks, which are then compared among each others using contour analysis.

## Running the code
> We highly recommend to run the code on google collab.
